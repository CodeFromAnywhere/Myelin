## How it works

1. you talk about your idea with AI
2. ai comes up with a precise specification
3. ai chooses apis
4. ai chooses operations
5. ai gets specification
6. ai implements solution
7. you login with github to push
8. you login with vercel to make the project
9. you login with actionschema to store your openapi
10. ai asks another agent to test your API
